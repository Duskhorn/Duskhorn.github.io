<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge75a67f">
<p>
Following a disastrous war 400 years ago, the <a href="#orgc988136">Superior Initiative</a> was created: a council above everyone, in order to keep peace between the 5 <a href="#org0c4e6c7">major powers</a> of the world: The Elected Empire of the light and dark elves; The Wandering Faith, tribal but united flying folk; The Bluest Abyss, silent realm of the water folk; The Free People, the most vigorous paladins of freedom and peace; lastly The Colossus, the Wise, Ancient, Forgotten Ones. For over 400 years, The Superior Initiative has helped build an utopia, guaranteeing strong diplomatic relations between the 5 Powers.
The <a href="#org34cce65">5 Ways of Magic</a> - Nature, Light, Dark, Astral and Eldritch - helped build and sustain the world; however, to everyone's disbelief, magic is dimming and is not as strong as it has been.
Eventually, the Superior Initiative ruled that new magic sources must be found: Thanks to the joint effort of the most efficient Elected Empire Light and Dark mages, The Wandering Faith's communion power, The Bluest Abyss underwater and seemingly endless resources and The Colossus' long forgotten knowledge, a Portal to a new world is now open. A new era has started: The Interdimensional Travel Era.
Unanimously voted by the Initiative via the Future Travelers Pact, The Free People have been required to form a Task Force for the first ever interdimensional travel.
Now it's your turn, Explorer: what awaits you behind the Portal?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org028c03e">
<p>
The Superior Initiative is a council composed by 5 members for each faction, for a total of 25 members. Laws created by the Initiative have a worldwide validity and its power is always recognized above state laws. Each government has the duty to enforce these rules, called either Pacts or Authorities.
</p>

<h4 id="org96f4fe8">Members and <a href="#org0c4e6c7">No description for this link</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org96f4fe8">
<p>
The current Ruler of each faction (be it king, emperor, president, pope&#x2026;) must have one of the 5 seats in the council.
Each member is elected using the method preferred by the faction's laws or customs; each mandate lasts 10 years, with the exception of the faction's ruler, which is in charge for as long as they're recognized head of their Faction or State. A non-ruler member can't be elected for two consecutive mandates, but they can be elected more than once

<h4 id="org942a5e1">Voting process</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org942a5e1">
<p>
Each faction gets one vote to emanate Pacts; in case of an invalid Pact vote (2 or more factions vote against or abstain) there's further discussion, until there's either another Pact vote, which has to be unanimous, or a Vote of Authority. A Vote of Authority is a vote where each one of the 25 members gets a secret vote. If the ruling passes during this phase, it's called an Authority.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgad8af52" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgad8af52">Pacts and Authorities</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgad8af52">
<p>
The only difference between a Pact and an Authority is the strictness in enforcement: while a Pact has to get enforced the day after, an Authority has a somewhat looser variable period of enforcement. Punishment for the failure to do so is decided by the rulers of the Superior Initiative. To this day this last comma has never been applied

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org27c832a">
<p>
Not much is known about the early years of The Free People; due to the extremely scattered and volatile nature of stories of early tribes and city-states, which are of wars, alliances, internal friction and general instability, there was "no time" to record history: even if there was, it'd be wiped out and changed from ruler to ruler. External early sources from The Colossus, evergreen spectators of the history of the world, or The Elected Empire, in a way or another avoid talking about it or skip over numerous details, deeming it irrelevant to other "much more important" matters - according to chronicles and historians of the time.
The resulting overall information is scattered and discordant, until a much more cohesive timeline can be made from the first unification led by the first group of revolutionaries, which created the first nucleus of the legendary Seven Tribes, what would later become The Free People.
Even then, much of the information has been distorted by oral tradition and impartial chronicles, elevating many details to legend and outright mythology

<li><a id="org2e06337"></a>The Revolution and the Seven Tribes<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2e06337">
<p>
Following some internal distress due to an alleged unnamed extremely barbaric tyrant, who had managed to conquer a quite considerable number of villages, cities and land, a sudden and uniform uprise of their inhabitants, composed by Ferrets, Lizards, Wolves, Lions, Elephants, Sergals and Kangaroos. According to legend, putting their differences aside, they fought and won against the evil tyranny that was plaguing their lands. From this, the first democratic council was held, and the decision to create the first ever democratic federation seen on the earth was taken.
Sources are contradictory, as expected, on how the battles have been fought and how the events unfolded. Protagonists and heroes are uncertain: there are recognized legendary "father figures", but their existence has been questioned for lack of sources. Nevertheless, everyone agrees on putting this Revolution as the starting point for the history of The Free People

<li><a id="org361e8bd"></a>The Great Unification<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org361e8bd">
<p>
The Seven Tribes had two main obstacles to overcome: the internal friction of the obvious differences between species and the external problems caused by the neighbours.
Due to some formidable bureaucracy and organization - according to The Elected Empire, even - the issue of protecting borders and internal stability was taken care of swiftly; laws about free circulation between citizens of the federation - a complete novelty at the time - followed by moderate laws for freedom of nonviolent expression and cooperation, increased productivity and general happiness.
This quick increase in wealth and power, thanks to the clever usage of natural resources of the area, too, lured the neighbors to join the federation. Over a little span of 10 years, from the seven inital tribes, the number grew to well over twenty. This extraordinary development period has entered history books as "The Great Unification"; it is such an important historical mark since it paved the start for international cooperation: the two main (at the time) powers all sent their ambassadors and stipulated treaties for trade routes, magical aid and technological help.
It also set in motion the events leading to the 400 year-long war, simply known as The War

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org783edee">
<p>
At the time of writing the number of tribes composing The Free People has grown to 35. The distinction between tribes is however blurry, since over time the internal borders have been made looser and looser, to the point it's just become for administrative and historical reasons, and people move from tribe to tribe constantly. Interspecies couple are very common too; most are attached to their hometowns and lands not because of a sense of nationalism, but because of familiar attachment.
Equality and fair opportunity for everyone is considered a great virtue, every citizen has its place in society and nobody is gatekept from trying to achieve their dream. It's not rare to see big and strong elephants be miniature artists or light dancers, while little and graceful mice are employed in the militia or hard labour.

<p>
Allegedly the first spark of the Revolution was pacifist, when Sa Rajan and his fellow elephants friends sat down and refused to work for, according to legend, 7 weeks. They demanded of better working conditions and the abolition of slavery. The Tyrant tried to make numerous offers, to which Sa Rajan declined one by one. In frustration, the Tyrant sent his militia to arrest them all, bring them to Tamran and interrogate the Immovable. Thus the first battle ensued and even though the elephants lost, they managed to break free thanks to the help of Silistgrem the Orator; their act of rebellion was the inspiration for many more to come, leading to the civil war soon after.

One of the only great magicians of these times, second only to The Wolf. Her unusual attunement with Light and Dark magic allowed her to become almost invisible; she was so elusve that it's told nobody could guess where she was at all times, even Amarindel struggled with it. Before beconing a member of the councul he was a scoundrel, born in the lowest class and had to live a life of crimes and thievery.
Her powers permitted her to enter silently the Tyrant's home during the Last Great Battle, letting the court's doors open thus allowing Pi'Rif to the Main Hall, where he could confront The Tyrant directly and put an end to both the conflict and the reign of terror.

Born as a slave and destined to waste his life into the gladiator's arena, after hearing the story of Sa Rajan, he decided to revolt and escape into the untamed forest and sabotage the Tyrant's army and merchants. It's said that he was the wisest of all and according to legend he chose himself the members of the council. He, however, in an unprecedented act of incredible selflessness, didn't ever put himself in a position of superiority over the other members, knowing he couldn't have had the strength alone to bring forth The Free People.

<p>
Born in a modest family and not in slavery, he was one of the few - at the time - to be an achademic and a defender lawyer for the Tyrant's Court. He had always cared about the rights of those considered to be the lesser ones. His magnificent ability to negotiate any hopeless situation into a better one had already granted him his nickname, the Orator. He was the one to interrogate Sa Rajan the Immovable after he got captured and subsequently free him, using his sibilant but sweet tone to soften the Tyrant's fury upon the elephants, granting them life but harsher living conditions and an ultimatum.

Legendary national heroin with her lover and husband.
Their sad but with a happy ending love story has been narrated in countless writings and sung by equally countless poets and bards; it's the quitenssential story of interspecies couples and interspecies love.
There's many different divergent stories but according to tradition, she was a Sergal warrior and he was a slave alchemist Raccoon; she fell in love and escaped with him, they both joined the Revolutionary movement and fought for their freedom to love, at the time considered taboo, they had to keep their relationship secret.
Damas got her nickname from the legendary Last Great Battle, where she singlehandedly defended a key outpost for 3 days before his lover's arrival with the renforcements. She fell exhausted by battle and wounds before his lover, who gave almost all of himself to cure her, showing others how deep their love was; people began to be impressed by how deeply they were connected and made them respected and celebrated figures. Many followed their example: many interspecies couples declared their love insipred by Damas and Tobias, a tradition alive to this day.

Renowned for his magical prowess in not one, not two, but three of the five ways - Nature, Astral and Eldritch - and famous for his numerous codexes, he was chosen in the council for his magical knowledge. He is the only aknowledged figure of the council, given the numerous sources citing him for his magic, aside from his own books. Besides that, he's the only one from the council to have had no role in the civil war, having decided to isolate himself as a hermit during the Rebellion.
After the first council he founded the School for Magical arts in the old capital city of Tamran, imprinting the pacifist and accepting direction of the school.
His infamous harsh and judging eyes, unbearable for almost every person to look at, is the reason of his nickname - the Burning Eyes.

The Elected Empire's history has always been tampered by internal bloody wars and conflict between the Light and Dark elves, too many to even remember. Eventually, a common spirit between the two of high moral began to rise in the people, pushing towards "The Compromise", a perpetual peace between the two. This gave birth to the great diarchy known as The Elected Empire. Together, they built a long-lasting Empire, never forgetting their roots, an almost frightening display of power.
This however doesn't mean there's always balance between the two races: in times of joy and laziness the Light prevails, while during hard and laborious times the Dark prevails. Prosperity is a time where the two apects are equal.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org163d756">
<p>
The Wandering Faith - short name for "The Wandering Faith of The Exalted Order of The Prophet Thimanus Under Demipantheus Himself" - is a theocratic oligarchy, tribalistic in nature and internal composition, whose citizens are all devoted to the god Demipantheus and Thimanus, his First Prophet.

<p>
The Wandering Faith's territory is the biggest of all the five Factions. Most of it, however, is either scarcely inhabited and inhospitable. There's also no mayor cities, given the nomadic nature of the people, which move in caravans from place to place, living a life of gathering and hunting.
There's however sedentary settlements, which are all exclusively temples, shrines and the main cave, where the ruling Council resides.
Laws are promulgated by the Council and are enforced by the Prophet, who acts both as judge and law enforcer; this is because the Prophet, which gets chosen between the strongest mages - though the locals attribute them divine powers - can enforce his decision magically. In reality his influence as "God's Word" is so strong that it's rarely the case; each tribe and each inhabitant - if one can call them like that - are extremely faithful to The Wandering Faith

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd8549b0">
<p>
Every bit of The Wandering Faith's history is oral.
Attempts to record chronicles has always met hostility from the tribes, the Council or the currently designated Prophet; moreover each tribe and caravan has its own tales, rendering impossible an unified and agreed history overall.
What is certain is that each tribe believes to descend from the One Tribe formed by Thimanus, ordered by the god Demiphanteus, which became so big and ungovernable that, according to Wandering Faith belief, Demiphanteus themself struck poison in their land and scattered the One Tribe apart.
What is certain is that at some point in time the Wandering Faith was really one single tribe and it scattered, probably due to the progressive desertification and proliferation of what locals call in their language "The Mold"

Narrating their history would be like narrating the history of the world - but I'll try to keep it short and relevant to the faction only.
The first ones of them were born with the World and idolatrized as gods, hunted like animals and treated like objects, so in the early days of their existence the first few sentient beasts started to gather to avoid any contatct. But soon problems arose: people were losing faith in magic and the were saddened by the loss of the "Ihu Ma" - the "First Breath" - that is magic, their provenance.
So they decided to be the first teachers of life, magic, languages and science. Eventually, once they felt the world was flowing in the right direction, they started appearing less and less, only in time of need. They appeared at the brink of wars to persuade the Factions to stop fighting each other.
After many millennia, their patience tested and broken by all the wars, the Superior Inititative was born from their wishes, tired of trying to fix the damages to their domain, the World.

Double pumping: at character creation, a player may decide to pick a cliche double pumped; each level costs 2 points instead of 1.

<li>An Old Eldritch Necromancer [3] wants to resurrect his lost partner fully, no zombie or spirit or anything less than a normal person.

<p>
<a href="https://www.risusiverse.com/home/rule-elucidation/advancement">"Campaign" section of this website, with a twist as explained below</a>
At the end of each session, players receive one or more Advancement Points. At any moment, one may choose to spend them to improve their existing clichés or make a new one. When a player wants to improve a cliché, they need to roll the current clichés maximum dice (yes, double pumps roll twice the dice). If the roll is equal or below the current number of Advancement Points, the roll is a success! Deduct the rolled number from the Advancement Points and increase the cliché by 1 die. If the roll is a failure, you lose one Advancement Point
</p>

<p>
Advancement Points may given for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The player has participated in the game session</li>
<li>The player has at least attempted to roleplay their character(s)</li>
<li>The player has overcome a challenge in a pretty clever way</li>
<li>The player has overcome a challenge in a fun way</li>
<li>The player has made significant improvement to a personal lore goal</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orga2c81f6">
<p>
Damian the Greasy has 8 Advancement Points and wants to improve his Professional Miner (2) cliché. He rolls 2 dice and gets a 7, which is enough to level up his cliché! He now is a Professional Miner (3) and has 1 Advancement Point.
Meanwhile, Gandalf the Grey would like to use his 16 Advancement Points to improve his Long Bearded Astral Wizard [3] cliché. Since it's a double pumped cliché, he would have to roll */*6 dice*/ in order to level up his cliché.

A cliche may get damaged after some actions or combat: a Wizard [4] may get exhausted and become Wizard [1], a Diplomat (3) may get beaten in a verbal discussion to a Diplomat (0), or a Warrior (2) may get wounded to a Warrior (1).
If in the middle of the battle, be it magic, swordfighting or a sermon in a trial, a player may use a cliche to "fight" against the damaged cliche.
For example, a Sorcerer [3] may try to infuse some magical prowess to a Wizard who lost 2 dice, as if it was a battle of "Sorcerer [3] vs Magic Fatigue (2)"; a Medic or Alchemist may do the same against a wounded Warrior

<p>
A player may decide to spend points at character creation to buy <b>perks</b> for his character. Each perk costs 1 point; there's no limits in how many a character may take, altough it will impact their cliches' strength. Generally speaking taking more than 2 perks is risky in term of cliche strength (but it's fun!).
Perks may be active or passive. Active ones have a certain amount of uses, while passive ones are "continuous" effects.

<p>
A cliche is an ability your character has; each cliche has a number, it represents how good that character is at that cliche.
The number is an integer ranging from 1 to 6

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Beginner</li>
<li>Novice</li>
<li>Professional  (baseline power)</li>
<li>Master</li>

<p>
<b>Important</b>: A character may not start with a cliche higher than 4; they may however be improved via experience!
More detailed cliches are considered better than plain cliches. More on that later

<h4 id="orga78a3e4">A couple words about backgrounds and backstories</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga78a3e4">
<p>
I personally suggest to think about a character idea before making the background and then expanding from there. There's no need for a very detailed background, however characters with a Detailed Background and Hooks - a character weakness - gain more points at character creations, one for the Background and one for a Hook.
Generally speaking, the more "eccentric" the character background the better, for the following reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cliches will "write themselves". For example, if your character has had a background of solitude and isolation, leading him to live in the wild, his "ranger" cliche may become "tacit and swift ranger of the Dark Lands"; in Risus, the more detailed the cliche the better!</li>
<li>The GM may use backgrounds and hooks to make better narratives (e.g. finding a lost brother, avenging a friend&#x2026;)</li>
<li>Interesting backgrounds make for deeper characters and more fun :D</li>
